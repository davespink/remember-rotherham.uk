      <p>Here we are in April 2025 and the world is burning, or so it seems.Trump 
        has set the light with trade wars, and
        the
        stock makert is in free fall. The war lingers on in Ukraine, and Britain
         is in a state of anxiety, with
        deminished
        tfust in the Starmer government. Hot tops are the economy, immigration, lack of free
         speech, goverment invasion
        of privacy. Resentments that have lingered on for years are coming to a head.
        In particular the government's reluctance to open a new enquiry into what has 
        been come to be known as
        "the Rotherham Grooming Gang scandal", or other similar words.
      </p>
      <p>

        The purpose of this website is to act as a resource for links and material 
        relevant to the scandal.
        It also will stand as a memorial, so that people never forget what happened
         in a northern steel town,
        after the reduction of the steel industry. It's called remember Rotherham 
        because unhappily that wars
        one of the first cases to come to light. But is was afterwards found to be 
        rampant and endemic to
        similar post industrial town in the north. There should be a Remember Telford, 
        Remember Oxford,
        any number of towns up and down the city. I hope people will make their
         own sites and try to keep
        the memory alive. The victims have been treated scandalously buy their abusers, 
        buy the police, by
        justice system, and by their own government. Stains on the national conscience.
